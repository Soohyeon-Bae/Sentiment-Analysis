Sentiment Analysis Performance Related to COVID-19 Based on Deep Learning

In this study, we aim to perform sentiment analysis related to COVID-19 using data collected from the global social media platform 'Twitter.' We propose a preprocessing method to remove unnecessary characters and symbols while maintaining the structural characteristics of Twitter. To convert the text into a format that computers can understand, we applied statistical-based embedding techniques and sentence-level embedding techniques. Using machine learning and deep learning methods commonly employed in the field of natural language processing, we conducted sentiment analysis and compared the performance of each method.
